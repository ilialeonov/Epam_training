footer.first = The identity of the criminal - a set of socio-psychological properties and qualities of a person, which are the causes and conditions of the commission of crimes.
footer.second = The personality of a criminal differs from the personality of a law-abiding person by public danger; he has criminal needs and motivation, emotional and volitional deformations and negative social interests. The problem of the identity of the criminal is one of the central for the sciences related to crime, and, above all, for criminology. The social danger of an individual is usually formed even before the crime is committed. This process finds expression in disciplinary and administrative offenses, immoral acts. However, in criminology, the moment of a qualitative transition from a person possessing socially dangerous qualities to the personality of a criminal is associated with the moment a person commits a crime. Some criminologists argue that the existence of the identity of the perpetrator can only be spoken within the time limits specified by law: from the entry into force of a court conviction and until serving the sentence and paying off a criminal record. Others point out that, in contrast to the penitentiary system, a criminologist must consider not only convicts, but also actual criminals, since the most experienced and dangerous criminals often evade criminal responsibility; not to take them into consideration is to not see a significant layer of criminal motivation.
footer.third = In any case, modern science believes that the presence of socially dangerous qualities in a person does not give grounds for \u201cadvancing\u201d treatment of him as a criminal.
